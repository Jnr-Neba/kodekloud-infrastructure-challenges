Tomcat Deployment Challenge
===========================

What I did:
- Installed Java OpenJDK 1.8
- Downloaded and installed Apache Tomcat 9
- Changed port from 8080 to 6200 in server.xml
- Created systemd service for auto-start
- Deployed ROOT.war application
- Made it run as 'tomcat' user (not root)

Key commands:
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y
systemctl start tomcat
curl http://stapp01:6200

Result: Successfully deployed Java web app on custom port
