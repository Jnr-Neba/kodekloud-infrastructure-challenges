Hands-on infrastructure automation: Bash, Tomcat, backup systems, and Linux administration for production environments

# Infrastructure Automation Challenges

Hands-on infrastructure projects showcasing automation, deployment, and system administration skills for production environments.

## üéØ Overview

This repository contains solutions to real-world infrastructure challenges, demonstrating:
- **Automation**: Bash scripting for operational tasks
- **Security**: SSH key management, secure file transfers
- **Deployment**: Application server configuration
- **System Administration**: Linux service management

## üìÅ Projects

### 1. [Automated Backup System](./backup-automation/)
Built a bash script that automates website backups with secure remote replication.

**Key Features:**
- ZIP compression of website files
- SSH key-based authentication (passwordless)
- SCP transfer to remote backup server
- Error handling and validation

**Technologies:** Bash, SSH, SCP, Linux

### 2. [Tomcat Application Deployment](./tomcat-deployment/)
Deployed Java web application on Apache Tomcat with custom port configuration.

**Key Features:**
- Apache Tomcat 9 installation and setup
- Custom port binding (6200)
- Systemd service management
- Security hardening (non-root execution)

**Technologies:** Tomcat, Java, Systemd, Linux
